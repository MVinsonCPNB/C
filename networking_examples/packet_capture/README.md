Packet Capture
==============

The packet sniff program was recoded for learning purposes and the example can be found at [Binary Tide](https://www.binarytides.com/packet-sniffer-code-c-linux/) 

The program works with a raw socket and intercepts most of the network traffic the networking device encounters. The packets intercepted are then stored into a log file within the directory.  Basic example of how to use sockets to intercept network chatter.
